plg_sociallogin
==============

A Joomla2.5 plugin to allow social login from [Janrain](http://janrain.com/).

Adapted plugin from [Util RPX](http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/access-a-security/site-access/authentication-cloud-based/9038) and [sociallogin](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sociallogin/).

Your users have enough of creating another account - just for your website. Let them log in to your Joomla!-powered website using the credentials of their favorite social service (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace, PayPal, OpenID, and many more).
